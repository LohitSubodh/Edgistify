## Projects on ML

Each project has a google colab link attached to it.

### Decision Trees and Random forests :
Used Decision Trees and Random Forests to predict if a given review
about a food is positive or negative depending on score and summary of
the review.
### Linear Regression :
Flammability Limit of chemical compounds is computed using Linear
regression from 105 molecular properties. Applied regularization techniques such as Lasso and Ridge
regularization that constrain the coefficients.

### Implementing MultiLayer Perceptron from Scratch :
Implemented Multi layer perceptron from scratch and used it for
classifying MNIST digits.Plotted the graph between training,Validation error vs epochs.

### Convolutional Neural Networks :
Used Convolutional Neural Network to classify whether a given image
contains a Cat or a Dog and generated confusion matrix. Found the best hyperparameters such as batch size and dropout ratio
for the model.

### Support Vector Machines :
• Used SVM to classify the level of risk associated with granting bail to a
person
• Plotted the decision function learned by the SVM classifier for
thesynthetic 2D dataset.
• .Plotted a heatmap of the correlation matrix for allattributes of
COMPAS Recedivism dataset.
